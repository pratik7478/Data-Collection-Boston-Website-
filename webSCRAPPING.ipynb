Instead of buying homes using traditional real estate agents, we are creating a self-service model where buyers can do most of the work themselves and earn 2% of the listing price as a reward.  Think of it this way, MassRealty is looking to take money from a broken system (everyone hates salesy real estate agents) and give it back to the middle class.  In essence, a $10k rebate for anyone who buys a $500k average home.  With that money, consumers can pay for their kids’ college fund, fix their kitchen, use it as a safety net, or anything they wish.  \n",

Phuc has started 5 companies over 20 years and has seen the tech industry change from requiring $20M+/100+ developers to build a product to only $800k/4 developers in his last startup.  Now, we have finally reached the golden age where a few developers can build amazing products in a few months and you will be learning from a master coder how to do this.\n",

If this is you, then take the “blue pill” and continue reading.  If you don’t know what I’m talking about then STOP, you are not what we are looking for.

Who is Phuc Truong (https://www.linkedin.com/in/phucvinhtruong)?

      "MassRealty is looking to disrupt the real estate industry by reimagining the buying process and putting the power back into the hands of the people.  Instead of buying homes using traditional real estate agents, we are creating a self-service model where buyers can do most of the work themselves and earn 2% of the listing price as a reward.  Think of it this way, MassRealty is looking to take money from a broken system (everyone hates salesy real estate agents) and give it back to the middle class.  In essence, a $10k rebate for anyone who buys a $500k average home.  With that money, consumers can pay for their kids’ college fund, fix their kitchen, use it as a safety net, or anything they wish.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In order for this self-service model to work, buyers will need guidance about neighborhoods and the best places to live and that’s where you come in.  You are going to build the tech that powers this (Yelp + Zillow + Youtube) but you are going to do it a completely revolutionary way.  Phuc has started 5 companies over 20 years and has seen the tech industry change from requiring $20M+/100+ developers to build a product to only $800k/4 developers in his last startup.  Now, we have finally reached the golden age where a few developers can build amazing products in a few months and you will be learning from a master coder how to do this.\n",

Instead of buying homes using traditional real estate agents, we are creating a self-service model where buyers can do most of the work themselves and earn 2% of the listing price as a reward.  Think of it this way, MassRealty is looking to take money from a broken system (everyone hates salesy real estate agents) and give it back to the middle class.  In essence, a $10k rebate for anyone who buys a $500k average home.  With that money, consumers can pay for their kids’ college fund, fix their kitchen, use it as a safety net, or anything they wish.  \n",

Phuc has started 5 companies over 20 years and has seen the tech industry change from requiring $20M+/100+ developers to build a product to only $800k/4 developers in his last startup.  Now, we have finally reached the golden age where a few developers can build amazing products in a few months and you will be learning from a master coder how to do this.\n",

      "Integrated Statistics is looking for a Data Management Coordinator to work with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) and Greater Atlantic Regional Field Office (GARFO). The Data Management Coordinator will work directly with staff from GARFO, NEFSC, and the Atlantic Coastal Cooperative Statistics Program (ACCSP) on a database merger project that will incorporate state fisheries data into a single comprehensive database for all US commercial fisheries catch in the Northeast.\n",
      "\n",
      "This position may be located in Woods Hole, MA or in Gloucester, MA. The position may begin with a period of remote work, to accommodate pandemic restrictions. \n",
      "\n",
      "Currently, NEFSC and GARFO have two parallel systems for catch monitoring and accounting, with the GARFO-led system focusing on quota monitoring and the NEFSC-led system supporting stock assessments and other research activities. The two systems each integrate data across a wide array of fishery information systems, and each approaches that integration slightly differently. Both systems require significant maintenance and upgrading as regulations and data streams change frequently. The Catch Accounting and Monitoring System (CAMS) implementation team is creating a single comprehensive database for all federal Northeast US fisheries catch.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Data Management Coordinator will work with the CAMS Project Manager and state natural resource managers to incorporate state data that is reported to ACCSP into CAMS. The Data Coordinator will also develop the technical specifications that ensure state data reporting to ACCSP is at a sufficient level of detail to allow incorporation in the CAMS database. The state data will remain housed at ACCSP, but will be linked to GARFO via relational database tables that integrate state fisheries-dependent data into CAMS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Duties\n",
      "The task includes but is not limited to these duties:\n",
      "\n",
      "    Coordinating the inclusion of state fisheries catch and effort data, including working with states to ensure their data reporting to ACCSP is at a sufficient level of detail to allow incorporation into the CAMS database.\n",
      "    Coordinating accurate, complete, and timely transfer of state level data from ACCSP to the CAMS database.\n",
      "    Working with the internal CAMS project team to develop a data management plan that outlines data capture, data flow, data queries, manual checks, and data listing to ensure data integrity.\n",
      "    Developing a process/method to ensure ACCSP’s Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) program provides timely feedback and correction of state data that parallels GARFO’s QA/QC program in coordination with the CAMS project team.\n",
      "    Working with data scientists to develop data management and visualization tools, including gathering/defining user requirements and performing user testing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Qualifications and Skills\n",
      "The Data Management Coordinator must:\n",
      "\n",
      "    Demonstrate proficiency in designing, creating, and implementing Oracle database systems.\n",
      "    Possess strong programming and development skills using PL/SQL (package, procedures, functions, triggers) and batch coding skills.\n",
      "    Possess the ability to manage large datasets, query, extract, and organize data in useful ways to reduce performance related issues.\n",
      "    Have experience in code migration, database change management and data management in multiple environments and different stages of the development life cycle.\n",
      "    Possess experience with data backup, data recovery, data dictionaries, and data standardization processes.\n",
      "    Possess the ability to handle multiple projects and deadlines with flexibility between tasks.\n",
      "    Have a track record of ensuring performance, security, integrity, and availability of databases.\n",
      "    Be able to support application development through integrated project work group meetings, data modeling, code reviews, and system reviews for quality and performance.\n",
      "    Demonstrate ability to work with management and developers in providing quick resolutions during critical production issues with performance related resolutions.\n",
      "    Implement and integrate security standards set by the NOAA/NMFS/ Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO).\n",
      "    Possess excellent written and oral communication skills..\n",
